    <h1>Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML</h1>
    <h3>Introduction to the Web</h3>

    <div class="box">
      <h4>World Wide Web</h4>
      <div class="description">  
        <p>The web is a collection of html documents that are all linked together by Hyper Links.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h4>HTML</h4>
      <div class="description">  
        <p>HTML = Hyper Text Markup
        <p>Everything online is made up of HTML.</p>

        <p>HTML is made up of:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Text content (what you see)</li>
        <li>Markup (what it looks like)</li>
        <li>References to other documents (images, videos)</li>
          <li>Links</li></ul>

        <p><b>HTML Mark-up</b></p>
        <p>HTML consists of opening tags and closing tags, which make up an element.</p>

        <p>HTML tags:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>"em"= <em>italics</em>
        <li>"b"= <b>bold</b>
        <li>"p" = paragraph
        <li>"h1" to "h6" = Defines HTML headings
        <li>"div" = defines a section in a document
        <li>"!DOCTYPE" = Defines the document type
        <li>"br" = Defines a single line break
        <li>"img" = Defines an image
        <li>"a"= anchor (this is a link)</li></ul>

        <p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>
        <p>HTML attributes are listed after the elements, but before the corresponding value. Links (a element) and images (img element) are self-closing and are considered Void tags beacuse they do not contain any content.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

   <div class="description">  
     <b>HTML Whitespaces</b>
     <p>Turns everything into one line. If we want to seperate the contents into multiple lines, we write "br" which is a Void tag for "break". The "p" tag is also used and is not a Void tag because it includes content.</p>

     <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
     <p>These two types of elements are used to separate content. An example of an inline element is "br" because it adds a break in the content and places the text on the next line below. An example of a block element is "p" because it creates an invisible blox around the content and also has a height and a width.
     Span is also an inline element and Div is a block element.</p>

     <b>Page Structure</b>
     <p>Websites are created like a house. The HTML is the structure, the CSS is the styling or decor, and Javascript is the functional parts or garage door.
